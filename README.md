## üîç About the project

**Project's goal:**
- The project aims to create a system for medical scheduling. Five classes were created: `Person`, `Patient`, `Employees`, `Doctor` and `Admin`. 
- `Person` and `Employees` classes are abstract classes. 
- `Person` is the superclass; `Patient` and `Employees` are subclasses of `Person`; `Admin` and `Doctor` are subclasses of `Employees`.
- Two interfaces were also created: `Calendar` and `Users`.

**Class Description:**
- `Person`: It has basic attributes: `name`, `birthdate`, `address`, `gender`, `phoneNumber`, `email` and `password`, in addition to the methods for scheduling and consulting the agenda;
- `Patient`: It's a subclass of `Person` and has as new attributes `cpf` and `healthInsurance`, in addition to the polymorphic methods of scheduling an appointment for themself, and checking which times are scheduled on their behalf;
- `Employees`: It's a subclass of `Person` and a superclass of `Admin` and `Doctor`. It has a new attribute `section` and a new method of defining schedules, creating a vacancy in the agenda, which can be scheduled by a patient;
- `Doctor`: It's a subclass of `Employees`, with the new attribute `crm` and `specialty`, in addition to the polymorphic methods to define their scale and consult their schedule;
- `Admin`: It's a subclass of `Employees` and has a new attribute `registration`, and new methods to register a user, consult data on active users, edit and delete users, in addition to defining a general scale - inherited from `Service` class -, performing appointments or consulting a general agenda - inherited from `Person` class -, and remove a scheduled appointment.

    ```
  - continue with author name
      eg: `feat/john-doe`
  - continue with short description
      eg: `feat/john-doe/implement-feature-x`
